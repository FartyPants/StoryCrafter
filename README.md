[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Q5Q5MOB4M)

Based on my previous BlockWriter extension, but extended much further!

Because I'm super lazy and I didn't have my coffee yet, I used the StoryCrafter to write manual for itself. So don't roll your eyes, I used llama 3.2 and this is how it sounds. Totally human, right?

Story beats are the building blocks of a narrative, representing individual moments or scenes that, when linked together, form the larger story. 
Beats can be thought of as paragraphs, scenes, or even smaller moments within a scene, such as a character's inner monologue or a descriptive passage setting the atmosphere. By focusing on one beat at a time, writers can craft a rich, nuanced story that flows logically from one moment to the next, with each beat informing and influencing those that follow. 

**Welcome to StoryCrafter: A Guide to Crafting Your Story**

StoryCrafter is a tool designed to help you write and generate stories beat by beat. With its intuitive interface and innovative features, you'll be able to craft compelling narratives that capture your readers' imaginations. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Add a New Beat**: Begin by creating a new beat, which is a short passage or paragraph that forms a key part of your story. This can be a scene, a character introduction, a plot twist, or any other important event that drives your narrative forward.

Note: Beats are numbered automatically. You can rearrange beats and delete them, but their number will not change. The number is more like an ID of the beat than anything else so the software can locate it and not the order. 

2. **Write Prompt**: Write your beat prompt in the designated prompt area, bringing your idea to life with vivid descriptions, engaging dialogue, and well-crafted prose. Focus on getting the essence of the scene down.

3. **Generate Text**: Once you've written your prompt, press Generate. This will generate your beat text and make it part of your ongoing narrative.

4. **Review and Edit**: Take a moment to review your beat, making any necessary edits to ensure it flows smoothly and effectively conveys the intended message. Doing edits early will also help further text generations to write in the same style and context. You can of course edit your beat at any time, and the changes will be reflected in your story.

5. **Multiple Versions**: StoryCrafter allows you to create multiple versions of each beat, giving you the flexibility to explore different approaches and styles. Try out different tones, perspectives, or plot directions, and see which one works best for your story. 
Just Select v1, v2 or v3 version and generate or write there. The selected version will be also the one in the full story.

**Unlocking the Power of Future Cues in StoryCrafter**

Future Cues are a powerful feature in StoryCrafter that allow you to shape the narrative trajectory of your story, ensuring consistency and coherence as you build upon your beats. Here's a concise guide on how to harness the potential of Future Cues:

1. **Understanding Future Cues**: Future Cues are directives that apply to the beats that follow the current one. They help in maintaining continuity and can be used to introduce significant changes or reminders that should be considered in subsequent beats.

2. **Adding Future Cues**: When you're adding or editing a beat, you can specify Future Cues. This could be anything from a change in a character's appearance, a shift in location, or any other detail that will be relevant to the story moving forward.

3. **Examples of Future Cues**:
   - Character Developments: "From this point on, refer to John as having a beard."
   - Setting Changes: "All future beats take place in the summer season."
   - Plot Twists: "Remember, the main character has amnesia and won't recall events before this beat."

4. **Using Future Cues in Beats**: As you generate new beats, StoryCrafter will take into account the Future Cues from previous beats. This means you can seamlessly continue your story, incorporating the changes and reminders you've set up.

5. **Flexibility and Control**: The beauty of Future Cues lies in their flexibility. You can add, modify, or remove them as your story evolves, giving you complete control over the narrative's direction.

By incorporating Future Cues into your storytelling process, you can craft a narrative that's not only engaging but also rich in detail and consistency. This feature allows you to plan ahead, ensuring that your story unfolds in a way that's both surprising and logical.

StoryCrafter offers two distinct modes for generating and crafting your story:
Instruct Mode and Narrative Mode.

Instruct Mode leverages the model's instruct template, allowing you to provide specific directives on how to generate text. For instance, you can instruct the model to "Write a paragraph, describing the Anna's house in details."

On the other hand, Narrative Mode operates more like a traditional notebook, without the constraints of a chat template. This mode allows for a more organic writing experience, as the model generates text based on the context and writing style of your previous beats. You can still use the prompt to direct the text generation.

By switching between these two modes, you can harness the full potential of StoryCrafter, using Instruct Mode for targeted text generation and Narrative Mode for a more intuitive and creative writing experience.

**Finalizing Your Masterpiece: The Full Text Tab**

As you've been crafting your story beat by beat, the Full Text tab has been waiting in the wings, ready to bring your entire narrative together. This tab is where the magic happens, as it dynamically generates the complete text of your story based on the beats you've created, the versions you've selected, and the edits you've made. Every time you make a change to a beat or switch between versions, the Full Text tab updates automatically, reflecting the current state of your story.

This tab is your chance to review your story in its complete form, ensuring that the pacing, plot, and character development all come together as intended.

**Unveiling the Lore Book: A Dynamic Story Companion**

Within StoryCrafter, the Lore Book acts as a treasured companion, holding the memories and lore of your story. This tool operates on a keyword-based system, where specific words or phrases in the prompt can trigger the recall of previously established facts, characters, settings, or events. 

Here's how it works:

As you write the prompt, the Lore Book associate keywords with the memory. These keywords can be characters' names, locations, magical items, or any other significant element within your story.

For instance, if you mention a character's name in the prompt, the Lore Book can provide context and helping you maintain consistency.

It can also suggest connections between different elements of your story, helping you to weave a richer, more complex narrative. 

Lorebook format.
kyword: 
memory

You can use multiple keywords with , (for example character first and last name separated by , - that means either will trigger the memory)

rimmer, arnold:

Arnold Judas Rimmer - A hologram of a deceased crew member, painfully neurotic, insufferably pompous, and obsessed with climbing the ranks of the Space Corps despite being utterly incompetent. Known for his pedantic obsession with Space Corps directives and his strained relationship with Lister.

**Tuning Your Story's Memory: The Settings Tab**

Located conveniently below the prompt area, the Settings tab offers a crucial tool for managing the scope of your story's recall. Here, you can determine how many previous beats will be included in the prompt text, effectively controlling the amount of context that influences the generation of new beats.

It's essential to strike a balance, as including too many beats can significantly slow down the storytelling process. If you find yourself needing more consistency or a broader understanding of your narrative's progression, consider an alternative approach. You can request a summary of your story thus far, and then add this summary to the World section within the Lore Book tab.

By doing so, you're not only ensuring that your story's core elements are preserved but also creating a rich tapestry of lore that can be drawn upon as you continue to craft your narrative. 

FP Note: :LOL, llama totally talks like ChatGPT... "rich tapestry".... guess what they used as training data, hahahaha
